  <h1>Employee SQL Database Project</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this project is to convert the 6 given csv
      files into an SQL database.
  </p>
  <p>After creating an ERD diagram, PostgreSQL was used to create
      the SQL tables and also import the data from csv files.
      Queries were then written and tested in Postgre to answer
      questions in the assignment.
  </p>
  <p>Lastly, the final SQL tables with data were imported into
      pandas where further analysis was conducted using Jupyter
      notebook and SQLAlchemy.
